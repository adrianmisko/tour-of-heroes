# TourOfHeroes

Actually, Angular and TypeScript are very nice.

Following project is a tutorial, it's neither big nor complex, but I learned quite a lot - CLI, project structure, ngModules, Angular's components (DI, data binding, templates, modular CSS), services with DI again, http requests and basics of RxJS futures (or observables).

I'll continue to use this project as Angular playground should time allow. Idiomatic animations, authorization and authentication, permissive routing, tests are just some of the topics I defenitely need to look into.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
